This is a coding test for OCS, built in C#. It simulates running a robot within a planet, see OCS_CodingTest_Backend -2.docx for the full problem specification

To build, please run dotnet publish MarsRover.Api.csproj -c Release -o <outputdirectory> -p:PublishProfile=Properties\PublishProfiles\FolderProfile.pubxml

The project is a self contained .net assembly that does both the REST API and CLI functions. Called with no parameters, it will start the API on http://localhost:5001, called with two file paths it will read the input file and pass it as request body to the API, then write the result to the output file. 

curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/Rover" -H "accept: text/plain" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"terrain\": [ [\"Fe\", \"Fe\", \"Se\"], [\"W\", \"Si\", \"Obs\"], [\"W\", \"Obs\", \"Zn\"] ], \"battery\": 50, \"commands\": [ \"F\", \"S\", \"R\", \"F\", \"S\", \"R\", \"F\", \"L\", \"F\", \"S\" ], \"initialPosition\": { \"location\" : { \"x\" : 0, \"y\" : 0 }, \"facing\" : \"East\" } } "

Projects:

- MarsRover.Api: Application entry point, contains the API controllers and the single CLI operation possible
- MarsRover.ApiClient: C# REST service client, autogenerated on build by NSwag
- MarsRover.Contracts: DTOs to be shared by both the system and clients
- MarsRover.Domain: Business logic for the system
- MarsRover.Domain.Tests: Unit tests for the business logic
